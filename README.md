# Federated-Learning-for-Stroke-Prediction

**ðŸ“Š Federated Learning for Stroke Prediction**
This project explores the application of Federated Learning (FL) to develop stroke prediction models in a privacy-preserving manner. By training models locally on distributed medical data without centralizing sensitive patient information, we demonstrate how FL can maintain high predictive performance while ensuring data confidentiality.

We evaluate multiple federated settings and aggregation strategies, measuring performance through metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC. The results show that FL is a practical and effective solution for real-world healthcare systems, especially where data privacy is critical.
